/**
 * <h1>GEM Layout Algorithm</h1>
 * <p>
 * Based on the work of Arne Frick, Andreas Ludwig, Heiko Mehldau: 
 * "A Fast Adaptive Layout Algorithm for Undirected Graphs"; 
 * Extended Abstract and System Demonstration; Faculty of Informatik of 
 * the University Karlsruhe; 1994
 * <p>
 * This Algorithm works by giving every cell a position and a temperature.
 * Then for every cell forces are computed. Every other cell repulses the
 * actual calculated cell away. On the other hand, cells, connected by edges
 * are attracted, until a minimum distance is reached. The result of this 
 * forces is a move of the position of the actual cell in the direction of
 * the force and with the length of the temperature. Then the temperature
 * will be decreased, if the last impulse and the current impulse looks like a
 * rotation or a oscillation. this is done for every cell until the temperature
 * of all cells or the average of the temperature of every cell is until a
 * given minimum value or a maximum of rounds is reached.

/**
 * Clusters a graph. Cells, contained in {@link #cellList} and not contained
 * in {@link #applyCellList} are clustered by this short algorithm. The
 * algorithm first tries to identify how many cells it should cluster. This
 * is calculated by subtracting the size of {@link #applyCellList} from
 * the size of {@link #cellList} and dividing the result by the 
 * {@link #clusteringFactor}. In the next step, the identified number of
 * clusters are created, and their position is initialised by random. Then
 * every clusterable cell is added to the cluster where the distance of the
 * vertex and the cluster is minimal. After adding a cell, the clusters position
 * is recalculated. Finishing this step, the algorithm tries to minimize the
 * number of clusters, by sorting the clustered vertices, if there is another
 * cluster, that distance is shorter than the distance to the cluster, the
 * vertice is actually in. This can happen, because by moving vertices into the
 * clusters, the position of the clusters are changed. The minimization runs
 * until no vertice can be moved anymore. empty clusters are removed and finaly 
 * the clusters are added to {@link #applyCellList}, because they should move
 * while the upcoming next calculations. That move can later be retrieved by
 * subtracting the attributes {@link #KEY_POSITION} and 
 * {@link #KEY_CLUSTER_INIT_POSITION}.
