We time the gsm app for uniprocessor c code by "toasting" the 10 copies of the bin/foo file, thereby producing foo.l.gsm. foo.l.gsm is 2890800 bytes large, meaning that 2890800/2 = 1445400 "shorts" were produced. Since the streamit version produces the 16 bit "short" outputs, we will normalize the c program to do the same thing.


Uniprocessor (7/29/2002):
(Xenon 2.2 GHz, 512MB cache)
1 iteration (1445400 outputs/iteration)
99.9% utilization (which is actually what it read, even though I am also suspicious given the disk accesses of the program)
runtime for 10^7 iterations = 8.47 seconds

We want cycles/iteration:
1 iterations/8.47 sec * 
1445400 outputs/1 iteration
1 second /2.2x10^9 cycles
* 10^5 cycles 

= 7.7567887 outputs/10^5 cycles
