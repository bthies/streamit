<title>Overview of streamit.scheduler2.iriter</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides iterfaces that need to be implemented in order to use the
scheduler.

<p>
In order to provide clean separation between the scheduler and the
rest of the code, the scheduler is implemented as a completely independent
library. It can be compiled without any other package. This package
provides an interface between the scheduler and the user.

<p>
Each user needs to implement these interfaces. Every scheduler extends
the <a href="./Schedule.html">scheduler2.Scheduler</a> class that the user
instantiates. The StreamFactory class will walk all the iterators, extract
all the appropriate information from the user, and pass it on to the
scheduler.

<p>
<i>
Note: This interface is probably an over-engineered solution to a simple
problem. The correct way of providing this functionality probably would
be to provide a basic Scheduler interface that each actual scheduler would
implement. A user would simply call this scheduler in order to 'create'
streams. Incidentally, this is pretty much the interface used in scheduler1.
