# Revision history for this file:
#   2/15/99  Initial port by John C. Gyllenhaal (www.crhc.uiuc.edu/IMPACT) 
#
# Predefined variables (defined by read_exec_info for use by this info module):
#
#   BASE_DIR="location of this module (e.g., impact/benchmarks/wc)"
#   RESULT_FILE="file containing stdout/stderr (e.g., wc t1 >& $RESULT_FILE)"
#   HOST_PLATFORM="host platform for profiling/emulation (e.g., hp)"
#   HOST_COMPILER="host compiler for libraries/header files (e.g., cc)" 
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT USAGE (see bench_info_tutorial for details):
#
#   1) Do not do *ANYTHING* in this info module except define the following
#      /bin/sh variables:
#
#      SETUP, PREFIX, ARGS, CHECK, CLEANUP, SKIP 
#
#      If necessary, you may set these variables based on the values of
#      HOST_COMPILER and HOST_PLATFORM.  For example:
#
#         if [ $HOST_PLATFORM = "hp" ]; then 
#            ARGS="< input1_big_endian.IN"; 
#         else 
#            ...
#
#      This file will be executed using sh's ". (this_file)".  It is fragile!
#      You may, of course, add comments. 
#
#   2) Here is the basic template for the usage of these variables:
# 
#      cd (target_dir)      # Some scripts use temporary directory 
#      ...                  # May build/copy/link in executable, etc. into dir
#      /bin/sh -c "$SETUP"
#      # Execute the benchmark with the provided prefix and args
#      /bin/sh -c "($PREFIX ./(executable_name) $ARGS) > $RESULT_FILE 2>&1"
#      CHECK_FILE=(execution_description).check
#      echo "> RESULT CHECK BEGIN FOR (benchmark)";
#      /bin/sh -c "($CHECK) > $CHECK_FILE 2>&1"
#      # Flag failure if $CHECK_FILE not empty and print out first 30 lines!
#      if [ -s $CHECK_FILE ]; then
#          (Print check error header, flag error, etc.)
#          head -n 30 $CHECK_FILE
#      fi
#      echo "> RESULT CHECK END FOR (benchmark)";
#      /bin/rm -f $CHECK_FILE  # Some scripts save if $CHECK_FILE is not empty
#      /bin/rm -f $RESULT_FILE # Some scripts save if $CHECK_FILE is not empty
#      /bin/sh -c "$CLEANUP"
#
#      When calling Lsim, '-Fskip=$SKIP' is added to arguments.
#
#   3) As shown, the commands will be executed using "/bin/sh".  
#      Commands specific to "/bin/csh" like "setenv" and ">& file" are not 
#      supported!  Use "set", "export", and "> file 2>&1" if necessary.
#
#   4) Use BASE_DIR (defined by read_exec_info) to locate inputs and outputs.
# 
#   5) Use SETUP to link all inputs into '.' to remove path variances 
#      from output file(s).  
#
#   6) ARGS should not explicitly redirect the output using '>' or '2>&1'.
#
#   7) CHECK should produce no output on correct execution.
#      Use 'spiff' to eliminate spurious output caused by rounding differences.
#      If diffing *huge* files, use '| head -100' to limit output on errors!
#
#   8) Use CLEANUP to remove input links and outputs (but not $RESULT_FILE).
#      Use specific file names, not wildcards, when deleting files!
#
#   9) Set SKIP to "WHO_KNOWS" if you have not calculated its proper value!
#      See bench_info_tutorial for instructions on how to calculate SKIP.
