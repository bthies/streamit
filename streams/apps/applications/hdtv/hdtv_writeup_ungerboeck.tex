The internal Ungerboeck encoder used in the HDTV encoder is
a 1/2 convolution code with a reach of 3. Figure~\ref{fig:ungerboeck-and-std}
shows a schematic diagram of an Ungerboeck encoder. For each input bit
that appears at the input Y1, two output bits are produces at Z1 and Z0.
The internal D (delay) blocks are registers which each hold state, marked
S0 and S1. We can also think about the encoder as a finite state machine.
Figure~\ref{fig:ungerboeck-and-std} is a fsm representation of the ungerboeck
encoder used in HDTV. Note that the initial state is 00, corresponding to 
both registers in Figure~\ref{fig:ungerboeck-and-std} being set to zero.

The reason that convolution codes are often called trellis codes is shown by 
Figure~\ref{fig:trellis-example}. The x axis represents time (discrete points)
and the y axis represents the possible states of the encoder. The solid lines
represent state transitions for an input of 0. The dashed lines represent
state transitions for an input of 1. As the input
data is encoded, a path is traced through the trellis. Each input sequence maps 
to exactly one path and each path maps exactly to one input sequence. It
is also important to note that each state only has

Table~\ref{tbl:ungerboeck_example} works out an example of encoding 
the data \texttt{0110101110} with our encoder,
and Figure~\ref{fig:trellis-example} shows the corresponding path through
the trellis. The grey states correspond to the state of the encoder 
at that time. 

\subsection{Decoder}

Decoding a bit stream that has been encoded with a convolution code is usually
done using the Virterbi decoding algorithm. The Virterbi decoding algorithm
is a well known algorithm in communication coding which is used in CDMA cellphones
and satellite receivers among other things. The Viterbi algorithm uses a dynamic programming
approach to determine the most likely signal sent given a recieved (possibly corrupted) signal. 
Chip Fleming has a great tutorial\cite{fleming:tutorial} which contains a walk 
through of the implementation of a trellis encoder and a Viterbi decoder 
for a slightly different 1/2 trellis code. His tutorial was the inspiration for this document.

Since each input bit in a convolution code affects several output bits
the Viterbi decoding algorithm reads in several input symbols in order to determine
several output symbols (eg it processes several symbols at a timie). In the
signal processing literature (reference?) it appears that one can get most
of the error correcting advantages of the convolution code by processing 7K input symbols
(where K is the reach of the code as described above). 5K symbols also yields
acceptable results.

Since each input sequence maps to a particular path through the trellis,
The main idea of the Vertibi decoding algorithm is to determine the most
likely path throught the trellis given the received symbols. The straightforward
approach would be to examine \textbf{all} possible paths through the trellis, and
choose the path's whose output is closest to the received symbols. The
straightforward approach is rediculously computationally intensive, 
and totally uncecessary. The Viterbi algorithm (named after Andrew Viterbi, a founder of Qualcomm)
uses a dynamic programming aproach to trace out the paths of the encoder's state. 

We will perform 7K steps in each iteration of the algorithm. 
At each step, we read 7K 2-bit symbol
from the input and we output 7K 1-bit symbols at the output. 
We are tasked with filling out a table: each element in the table, $c[s,t]$, 
represents the accumulated error if the encoder were in state s at time t. 
Accumulated error is definied as hamming distance
(or euclidian distance) of received symbol to the expected symbol.

Our problem: we are sitting at the decoder, and we receive symbol $R_t$ at time $t$. We want to fill in 
$c[s,t*]$ for all possible states $\mathcal{S}$ (the Ungerboeck encoder we have 4 states).

Algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each received Symbol $R_t$ at time $t$
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute $c[s,t] \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$ (eg compute the entries
 	       of c[s,t] for each of the possible 4 states.)
	\item Remember which predecessor state was used to compute each $c[s,t]$ in
	       a predecessor table.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Reconstruct the path through the trellis with c and the predecessor states.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item find $s^*$ such that $c[s^*,7K]$ is minimum. (eg at the end of the trellis, 
	       after we have looked at all input symbols, choose the state we would 
	       be in at the last time. 
	\item We then use the predecessor table to walk back through the trellis
	       along the path which yields the least possible error (which we have 
	       been calculating along the way.
	\item Once we have recovered our most likely path, we can recreate the
	       input sequence that was most likely sent.
	\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

Determining $c[s,t]$ for all possible states (in 1(a) above) is not obvious.
The algorithm to determine it is explained below.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each received symbol $R_t$ received at time $t$ we compute 
       $c[s,t] \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$ by using the entries of $c$ for 
       the previous time (eg $c[s,t-1]$).
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each $s \in \mathcal{S}$
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $q^0$ and $q^1$ be the two possible previous states
		       that lead to $s$. $q^0\rightarrow s$ when an input of 0
		       was received, and $q^1\rightarrow s$ when an input of 1 
		       was received. These transitions produce symbols $R^0$ and $R^1$
		       respectively.
		\item Let $e^0$ be the hamming distance between $R_t$ and $R^0$ (eg the hamming
		       distance between the received symbol and the expected symbol if the input was 0). 
		       Similarly, let $e^1$ be the hamming distance between $R_t$ and $R^1$.
		\item Now, calculate $c[s,t] = min(c[q^0,t-1] + e^0, c[q^1,t-1] + e^1)$
		\item And remember which state ($q^0$ or $q^1$) was a predecessor state to s in the 
		       predecessor table.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Since that discussion was filled with lots of math and symbols, 
lets make the algorithm concrete with a worked through example.

\subsection{Ungerboeck Decoder Implementation}
Each table is two dimensional: states and time. Each unit of time corresponds to
receiving 1 symbol (so in this case receiving 2 bits). Each cell represents something
for a particular state at a particular time. The algorithm fills up both tables as
time progresses. When the tables are full, it traces back through the table and finds the
path that results in the fewest errors occuring.

The error metric that is used can either be hamming distance or euclidian distance (basically
hamming distance squared).

The first table keeps track of accumulated errors. accumulated\_error[s,t] is the hamming distance
between the output that the current min path to state s at time t would generate and the
symbols that have been received. 

The second table keeps track of the previous states, so that the min path
can be reconstructed. predecessor\_states[s,t] represents the state s' of the encoder
in the minimum path that leads to s at time (t-1)
