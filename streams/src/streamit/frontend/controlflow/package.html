    <p>
Control-flow and data-flow analysis for the StreamIt front-end IR.
Data-flow analysis is important for several applications, and is used
by the front-end's semantic checker to verify correctness of types in
pipelines.  {@link streamit.frontend.controlflow.CFG} provides an
immutable control-flow graph representation for a function, which is
built by {@link streamit.frontend.controlflow.CFGBuilder#buildCFG}.
The graph is built up of {@link
streamit.frontend.controlflow.CFGNode}s, each of which contains at
most one statement or expression.
    </p>
    <p>
Data-flow analyses have two parts.  A generic engine is provided in
the {@link streamit.frontend.controlflow.DataFlow} class; actual
analyses are derived from this class, and must provide the initial
lattice value and a flow function.  Lattice values are derived from
{@link streamit.frontend.controlflow.Lattice}.
