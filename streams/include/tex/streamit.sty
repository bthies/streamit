% Cause the `listings' package to exist, and define a `streamit'
% language for it...
\RequirePackage{listings}

% What should basicstyle be set to here?  Its default value doesn't
% cause inline code segments to be highlighted at all.  \sffamily
% gets around this, but computer modern sans serif bold is too heavy
% compared to the rest of the text (this seems odd to me).  \ttfamily
% doesn't have bold.  We might experiment with PS fonts, or with using
% \sffamily but also setting keywordstyle to empty.
%
% ...experimenting with postscript fonts: \usepackage{palatino} or
% \usepackage{times} gets us Helvetica for \sffamily, which is fine,
% but it looks bad and is just too big besides.  \ttfamily then is
% Courier, though, which has bold and arguably looks better than
% anything else we've looked at.  Courier bold is noticably heavier
% than not-bold, though.
%
% Combinations that seem to work reasonably:
% -- CM, basicstyle=\sffamily,keywordstyle={}
% -- CM, basicstyle=\ttfamily (no boldness)
% -- PS, basicstyle=\ttfamily
%
% The literate option also looks better if we're using
% \sffamily, but isn't strictly speaking correct.
