Hand-written StreaMIT compilation examples
==========================================

streams/docs/examples/hand contains hand-written examples of how the
StreaMIT compilation might work.  In general, the C and Java code
should be compilable against the respective run-time libraries.
The StreaMIT code should be compilable to something structurally
similar to the provided C and Java source.

Here's a short description of each of them:

autocor			An auto-correlation kernel.

delay			A delay element that outputs 0 for the first N 
			elements and then outputs whatever is flowing 
			through the stream.

fft			A few implementations of FFT.

fib			Fibonacci implemented with peeking.
	
fib2			Fibonacci implemented without peeking

file			Just tests a FileWriter.

fir			Pieces together FIRFilter from library into pipeline.

flybit			A piece of the Butterfly from FFT.

fm			The FMRadio we've been using in our benchmark suite.

fuse			Two-filter fusion test.

fuse-test		UpSampling/MovingAverage fusion test.

hello6			Hello world.

hello-separate		Hello world, but naming components before adding them.

lattice			N-deep lattice filter.

mergesort		N-element merge sort.
	
peek-pipe		Something that peeks into a pipeline.

script-ratios		Tests scripted rates.

simple-split		Good test case of a splitjoin.

unroll			Tests unrolling.

updown			Tests messaging.

weighted-rr		Tests weighted round robins.
