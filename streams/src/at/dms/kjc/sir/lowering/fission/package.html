<body>

<p>
Provides compiler passes to split (parallelize) a filter into a set of
fine-grained filters.  The primary application of fission is to expose
parallelism for execution on a distributed machine.

<p>
The 
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fission.StatelessDuplicate} pass splits
<em>stateless</em> filters into a number of filters that are wrapped
in a splitjoin, while the 
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fission.VerticalFission} pass splits
<em>linear</em> filters into a pipeline.  Both passes can be called
directly; the StatelessDuplicate pass is also called automatically
from the dynamic programming partitioner via the 
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fission.FissionReplacer}.
