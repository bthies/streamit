% NORMALISE2DPTS - normalises 2D homogeneous points
%
% Function translates and normalises a set of 2D homogeneous points 
% so that their centroid is at the origin and their mean distance from 
% the origin is sqrt(2).  This process typically improves the
% conditioning of any equations used to solve homographies, fundamental
% matrices etc.
%
% Usage:   [newpts, T] = normalise2dpts(pts)
%
% Argument:
%   pts -  3xN array of 2D homogeneous coordinates
%
% Returns:
%   newpts -  3xN array of transformed 2D homogeneous coordinates.  The
%             scaling parameter is normalised to 1 unless the point is at
%             infinity. 
%   T      -  The 3x3 transformation matrix, newpts = T*pts
%           
% If there are some points at infinity the normalisation transform
% is calculated using just the finite points.  Being a scaling and
% translating transform this will not affect the points at infinity.
